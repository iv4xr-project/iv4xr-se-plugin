/**
 * Implements a 3D-grid-based navigation graph. The space is thought to be discretely
 * divided into small unit cubes (of size 1x1x1 unit). The orientation of these cubes
 * are aligned to the x/y/z axes of the space.
 *
 * For this particular implementation, most of the space is assumed to be empty (not
 * containing obstacles) and is only sparsely populated by objects that obstruct
 * navigation. So, rather than explicitly representing each unit cubes in the memory
 * (there can be prohibitively lots of them) we will use a sparse representation, where
 * only the unit-cubes that intersect with objects (e.g. walls or buildings) will
 * be kept in the memory.
 *
 * The type of navigation supported by this class is "above ground" navigation. It
 * assumes there is a flat ground surface. The surface on the ground is assumed to be
 * navigable, and flat. On the other hand, the ground beneath this surface is assumed
 * o be unnavigable. The ground surface is also assumed to extend infinitely (it has no
 * "edge of the world" that would allow an agent to wrap around to go beneath the
 * ground surface :D ).
 *
 * So, the above means that only the ground surface and the space above it are
 * navigable.
 *
 * For flexibility, the origin of the grid does not necessarily co-incide with the
 * origin of the space's own 3D coordinate system. However: (1) the x/z surface with
 * y = origin.y is assumed to be navigable, and (2) the grid's x/y/z axes
 * are parallel and point to the same direction as the space's own x/y/z axes.
 *
 * The actual size of a unit cube is specified by the static variable CUBE_SIZE.
 * Each unit cube is identified by a triple (x,y,z) where x/y/z are integers. If
 * the grid origin is located in the actual location o in the space, the actual
 * location of the cube (x,y,z)'s center is:
 *
 *     (CUBE_SIZE*(x + 0.5) + o.x, CUBE_SIZE*(y + 0.5) + o.y, CUBE_SIZE*(z + 0.5) + o.z)
 *
 * For example, the center of cube (0,0,0) is:
 *
 *     (o.x + 0.5*CUBE_SIZE, o.y + 0.5*CUBE_SIZE, o.z + 0.5*CUBE_SIZE)
 *
 * actual location of tenter of this cube is then
 *
 * TODO: for now are limited to this kind of blocks:
 *   (1) obstructing objects are assumed to be in the shape of cubes as well (though they are usually bigger).
 *   (2) these object-cubes (called blocks) are xyz-aligned. That is, they have their ribs parallel with
 *       the world/space x/y/z axes.
 *   (3) the blocks are not moving nor rotating.
 *
 * TODO: for now we don't check if a square on the grid is actually a SOLID floor (e.g. it
 *  could be a gaping hole in space). We can do this by maintaining a list of squares
 *  with solid floor.
